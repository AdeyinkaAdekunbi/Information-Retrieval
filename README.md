# Information Retrieval using Elasticsearch

This project focused on designing and implementing search solutions using Elasticsearch to analyze a dataset containing news articles. 
The primary goal was to create effective analyzers for organizing and searching the dataset, followed by indexing and retrieving information based on user queries.

# Key Achievements
Designed specific analyzers for organizing and searching fields within the dataset.<br/>
Successfully indexed the dataset using Kibana’s file upload tool and configured the designed analyzers and similarity scripts.<br/>
Implemented effective search queries to handle different user scenarios, demonstrating the capabilities of Elasticsearch.

# Objectives
To examine and categorize dataset fields for suitable search and organization.<br/>
To design and implement Elasticsearch analyzers tailored for organizing and searching fields.<br/>
To index the dataset using Kibana and configure the search solution.<br/>
To perform search queries based on user scenarios to retrieve relevant news articles.

# Technologies Used
Elasticsearch: For creating analyzers, indexing data, and performing search queries.<br/>
Kibana: For uploading and configuring the dataset.

# Key Findings
Organizing Field Analyzers: Used for fields such as source, media type, and published date. These fields were configured with keyword and date analyzers to facilitate filtering and sorting.<br/>
Searching Field Analyzers: Applied to title and content fields, combining pipelines like keyword, tokenization, case folding, stop word removal, and stemming. The news_search_analyzer was created for full-text searches, and an autocomplete_news_search_analyzer was designed for autocomplete functionality.<br/>
Similarity Scores: Implemented using the TF-IDF equation to rank search results.

# Conclusions
The designed analyzers effectively processed the dataset, allowing for efficient searching and organizing of news articles.<br/>
Elasticsearch’s built-in tools and custom scripts facilitated the creation of robust search solutions tailored to specific user needs.<br/>
The project demonstrated the importance of tailored analyzers for different types of fields within a dataset to enhance search accuracy and performance.

# Implications
The search solutions can be applied to similar datasets requiring efficient information retrieval.
Custom analyzers and similarity scoring can significantly enhance the user search experience by providing more relevant results.
The project provides a framework for implementing Elasticsearch solutions in real-world scenarios, improving data accessibility and usability.
